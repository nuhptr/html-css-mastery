1) Default syntax:

const add = (a, b) => {
    const result = a + b;
    return result; // like in "normal" functions, parameters and return statement are OPTIONAL!
};
Noteworthy: Semi-colon at end, no function keyword, parentheses around parameters/ arguments.

2) Shorter parameter syntax, if exactly one parameter is received:

const log = message => {
    console.log(message); // could also return something of course - this example just doesn't
};
Noteworthy: Parentheses around parameter list can be omitted (for exactly one argument).

3) Empty parameter parentheses if NO arguments are received:

const greet = () => {
    console.log('Hi there!');
};
Noteworthy: Parentheses have to be added (can't be omitted)

4) Shorter function body, if exactly one expression is used:

const add = (a, b) => a + b;
Noteworthy: Curly braces and return statement can be omitted, expression result is always returned automatically

5) Function returns an object (with shortened syntax as shown in 4)):

const loadPerson = pName => ({name: pName });
Noteworthy: Extra parentheses are required around the object, since the curly braces would otherwise be interpreted as the function body delimiters (and hence a syntax error would be thrown here).

That last case can be confusing: Normally, in JavaScript, curly braces always can have exactly one meaning.

const person = { name: 'Max' }; // Clearly creates an object
if (something) { ... } // Clearly used to mark the if statement block
But when using arrow functions, curly braces can have two meanings:

1) Mark the function body (in default form)
2) Create an object which you want to return 
(in shorter function body form)
