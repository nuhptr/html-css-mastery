-  Object is include new data in new object using spread operator

## This Keyword

Generally, this refers to the "thing" which called a function (if used inside of a function). That can be the global context, an object or some bound data/ object (e.g. when the browser binds this to the button that triggered a click event).

1. this in Global Context (i.e. outside of any function)

```javascript
function something() { ... }
```

`console.log(this); // logs global object (window in browser)` - ALWAYS (also in strict mode)!

2. this in a Function (non-Arrow) - Called in the global context

```javascript
function something() {
   console.log(this)
}
```

something(); // logs global object (window in browser) in non-strict mode, undefined in strict mode

3. this in an Arrow-Function - Called in the global context

```javascript
const something = () => {
   console.log(this)
}
```

`something(); // logs global object (window in browser) - ALWAYS (also in strict mode)!`

4. this in a Method (non-Arrow) - Called on an object

```javascript
const person = {
   name: "Max",
   greet: function () {
      // or use method shorthand: greet() { ... }
      console.log(this.name)
   },
}
```

`person.greet(); // logs 'Max'`, "this" refers to the person object

5. this in a Method (Arrow Function) - Called on an object

```javascript
const person = {
   name: "Max",
   greet: () => {
      console.log(this.name)
   },
}
```

`person.greet(); // logs nothing (or some global name on window object)`, "this" refers to global (window) object, even in strict mode
this can refer to unexpected things if you call it on some other object, e.g.:

```javascript
const person = {
   name: "Max",
   greet() {
      console.log(this.name)
   },
}
```

```javascript
const anotherPerson = { name: "Manuel" } // does NOT have a built-in greet method!
```

`anotherPerson.sayHi = person.greet; // greet is NOT called here, it's just assigned to a new property/ method on the "anotherPerson" object`

anotherPerson.sayHi(); // logs 'Manuel' because method is called on "anotherPerson" object => "this" refers to the "thing" which called it
If in doubt, a console.log(this); can always help you find out what this is referring to at the moment!
